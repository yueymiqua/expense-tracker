# Expense-Tracker Application

This is an application that allows users to keep track of their transaction history, for both income and expense!
Built with React for the front-end, Node/Express for the back-end, Mongoose for the business-layer logic, and MongoDB for the noSQL database.

## Get Started Using This App

To get this project started, download the source code of this entire repository.
Once downloaded, navigated to the project root folder and type "npm install" in the CLI to download all required dependancies.
Once all dependancies are finished downloaded, type "npm run dev" in the CLI of the project root folder and it will simultaneously run the Client and Server at the same time(with the help of Concurrently). 
The Client is active on port 3000 while the Server is active on port 5000.
The application is now fully-functional. Happy Transaction-Tracking!
